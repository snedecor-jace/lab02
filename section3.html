        <h2>Is Seattle Walkable?</h2>
        Seattle, at least by North American standard, is very walkable. A bus network covers
        pretty much the entire city and the One Line is a vital part of the city’s transportation
        network. Quite a few roads have separated bike lanes, though a city-wide bicycle network
        has yet to come to fruition. There’s also a pretty small tram network downtown, and I have
        seen a few downtown intersections with signal priority for buses. Of course, many cities
        in Europe would likely blow Seattle out of the water in terms of walkability. There is a
        lot to look forward to, however! In the case of the One Line, the city plans on expanding
        it quite extensively! To find out more, check out the <i>third link</i>.
